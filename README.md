# Bayesian Change Point Analysis

This analysis was undertaken as part of a university project, using Bayesian Statistics to identify possible change points in a mining disasters dataset.

My report outline the steps I took, and the implications and limitations of my work.

It's presented here in a Jupyter notebook, which can be [previewed with nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/charlywhitlow/bayesian-change-point-analysis/blob/main/bayesian-change-point-detection.ipynb).
